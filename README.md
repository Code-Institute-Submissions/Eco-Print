---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Milestone Project 1

### Purpose
This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS Modules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
- To be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
- To view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.

### Returning Customer Goals

- To order products online.
- To contact the organisation so they can request more information.

### Frequent Visitor Goals

- To order/topup on products.
- To check to see if there are any new services offered.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Design-

All Pages contain a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs the user to a new Page to allow users to Navigate the site easily. The Nav Menu is repositioned on a Mobile device to make use of space on smaller devices.

Color - The Color scheme was used to convince the user into believing this company is the ECO friendly printing service it preaches, it keeps up the enviromental leaf green along with clean charcoal grey lines and text. The opaque white divs with box shadow keeps up the "paper like" appearance.

Typography - The Font used in this project is called "Lobster" from Google Fonts with a fall back of "sans-serif".

Background - I Used Adobe Illustrator to create the background image by simply using the line tool and bending it and filling the color.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Business Goals-

* To show the user how Eco Print is a better eco friendly company and why they should use these services.
* Provide Further information about why Eco Print uses eco friendly methods and educate the user.
* Gain custom at the same time as saving the planet, providing users with a talking point to other potential users.

## -Target Audience-

* Users looking to buy paper/card products ie leaflets and business cards.
* Users looking to share ideas on how to recycle and save our planet.

## -User Goals-

* Purchase Products.
* Learn how companys like Eco Print are helping to reduce waste and save our planet.
* Be inspired to research ways to protect our planet.

Not all users who come across Eco Print will be looking to purchase but maybe looking to further educate themselves. For this reason Eco Print provides links to facts and websites to further investigate.

The Nav consists of 2 _Unordered Lists_ the top being more information and existing user based and the bottom your standard Navigation between pages.

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button, This is because it is featured across all pages.

Add the ability to choose a design and customize it for checkout.

Add Image work instead of placeholder image for flyer.

Add Links to different paper types that leads to upload and customize page.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Testing-

All pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience and web pages have been Styled accordingly.
During this time i realised i made some silly mistakes mainly with sizing and had to go back through and change some size values to work correctly.

Once testing was complete and i was satosfied with the result i used validators to ensure my code was up to standard,
I did this using W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw Validator for CSS.

As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality at this time, the testing performed was on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing has been done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes down to 320px wide.

All nav links direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

All links to external websites open in a new browser.

All links show a difference in Color when you hover over the link.

All images are responsive, some have been hidden including their containers on some page sizes also.

The Video is responsive in the fact on smaller size screens it is hidden and so is its parent container, this is not a bug but intentionally done. The video also has user controls and can be opened in youtube externally in a new tab.

### Lighthouse - Dev Tools
![Lighthouse](https://github.com/TechCentreUK/Printing-Company/blob/master/readme_images/lighthouse.png)
\
I used lighthouse in dev tools to test the website in many ways, for example i had to test my text colors contrast and adjust accordingly.
As you can see by the above screenshot i used this to improve the websites overall performance.

### Chrome Dev Tools and Responsive Mode
Chrome Dev Tools played a huge role in my testing on a day to day basis, i was able to edit my css in real time to confirm the code im writing had to correct output as i was coding. It mostly helped when Styling for responsive mode.

### Links
I tested all links across all pages to make sure they all redirect to the correct pages. I also made sure that for links leadng to external websites i used the target _blank attribute to open a new tab so the user does not lose place on our website.

### Browsers
I Tested compatibility across browsers by using Safari, Chrome and iOS Safari. As an extra measure i also tested browser compatibilty across more browsers using the plugin [User-Agent Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Unfixed Bugs-

Pages are missing and yet to have links added to the correct places, this is both a time and knowledge restriction as i am yet to learn javascript and more to add the features in i would like for example order tracking, login and customization page.

I would liked to have spent a bit more time styling some of the items that was set to visibility hidden to suit the responsive design when it could have been styled differently and had been kept in view.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Deployment-

### Creating My Website
To create this project I used the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template by navigating [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the button labelled 'Use this template'.

Next i was directed to the 'create new repository from template page' and entered in my repo name, then clicked create repository from template button.

The commands used for commits throughout the project:

git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.
git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

### -Git Hub Pages-

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

2. At the top of the Repository (NOT at the top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. Click Save and the page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section. Alternatively click this [Link](https://techcentreuk.github.io/Printing-Company/)

### Forking
Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. - This is the definition from Github Docs.

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

2. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

3. Fork

4. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

### Clone

1. Navigate to the Github Repository you want to clone.

2. Click the drop down menu labelled "Clone".
