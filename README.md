## -Unfixed Bugs-

Pages are missing and yet to have links added to the correct places, this is both a time and knowledge restriction as i am yet to learn javascript and more to add the features in i would like for example order tracking, login and customization page.

I would liked to have spent a bit more time styling some of the items that was set to visibility hidden to suit the responsive design when it could have been styled differently and had been kept in view.
